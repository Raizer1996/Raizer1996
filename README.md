Cybersecurity specialist with over 2 years of hands-on experience in Cyber Security, Incident Investigation, Incident Response, Threat Hunting, and Research. Skilled in both defensive and offensive security, with proven expertise in identifying, investigating, and mitigating threats by analyzing incidents and conducting proactive threat hunting. Practical Penetration Testing background enables a holistic approach combining incident response with adversarial simulation for robust organizational protection.

Completed Cyber Security Penetration Tester Course at See Security College, with a hands-on focus on offensive security, red teaming, exploitation, and advanced attack simulations

Strong foundation for 5 years from Military. 

Core strengths:
1) Advanced threat detection, incident response, and comprehensive investigations

3) Deep experience with SIEM (ArcSight), EDR (CrowdStrike), and security analytics platforms (Elastic & Kibana)
